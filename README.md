# LaundryLine

This is an iOS & Android mobile application created using the React Native framework that solves issues that UT students face with laundry in dormitories through crowdsourcing. With the app, users can update and check the real-time statuses of washers and dryers on their residence floors. 

The back-end of this application consists of user authentication and email verification with Firebase, storage of user login data and laundry machine states in Cloud Firestore, as well as real-time customized group chatting and texting individualized for each residential floor through Firebase's Realtime Database. Meanwhile, the front-end utilizes a variety of cross-platform UI/UX component toolkits such as the Material UI Library.
